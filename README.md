- TAB (The TAB key switches between Tile and Entity mode, allowing designers to quickly switch between adding tiles and entities).
- Space (The Space Key cycles through each tile/entity and will eventually revert back to the first one).
- Enter (The Enter Key saves the map data and exports it to a JSON file that can be found in the level editors netcoreapp3.1 folder. 'Terramental_LevelEditor\LevelEditor\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1').
