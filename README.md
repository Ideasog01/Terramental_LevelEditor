# Terramental_LevelEditor

Welcome to this guide for the Level Editor.

/// Button Map ///

- TAB (The TAB key switches between Tile and Entity mode, allowing designers to quickly switch between adding tiles and entities.)
- Space (The Space Key cycles through each tile/entity and will eventually revert back to the first one).
- Enter (The Enter Key saves the map data and exports it to a JSON file that can be found in the level editors netcoreapp3.1 folder. 'Terramental_LevelEditor\LevelEditor\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1').

/// Exporting and Importing Map Data /// Step-By-Step Guide ///

(1) To export the Map Data, simply use the Space key to save the Level.
(2) Locate the MapData.JSON file located in the netcoreapp3.1 folder. 'Terramental_LevelEditor\LevelEditor\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1'
(3) Copy the MapData.JSON file.
(4) Paste the MapData.JSON file in the equivalant folder in the Terramental Project.
(5) Once the MapData.JSON file has been pasted, the level should load.
(6) Save the MapData.JSON file in the shared google drive folder to ensure the level is not deleted.
